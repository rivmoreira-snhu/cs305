Artemis Financial Secure Software Practices Report
Summary of Client and Software Requirements
Client: Artemis Financial, a financial services company with a primary focus on data protection.
Requirements: Artemis sought a vulnerability assessment and secure coding practices to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive financial data. This involved identifying and mitigating security risks, with emphasis on encryption and secure data transmission.

Identifying Software Security Vulnerabilities
What Was Done Well: I efficiently identified high-risk vulnerabilities, prioritizing issues that could have the greatest impact on Artemis’s systems.
Importance of Secure Coding: Secure coding prevents data breaches, builds client trust, and ensures compliance with industry regulations, ultimately enhancing company resilience and reputation.

Challenges and Key Takeaways from the Vulnerability Assessment
Challenges: Assessing the intricate data flow within Artemis’s systems was complex, but it reinforced the importance of thorough analysis to ensure robust security.
Helpful Aspects: The structured approach allowed me to systematically identify and address vulnerabilities, which highlighted the value of a secure SDLC (Black Duck, 2022).

Increasing Layers of Security
Implemented Layers: SSL/TLS protocols for data encryption, AES for data confidentiality, and exception handling to safeguard against unexpected algorithm failures.
Future Tools and Techniques: Automated vulnerability scanners and regular security audits would be beneficial to enhance proactive threat identification.

Ensuring Functionality and Security Post-Refactor
Verification Process: While the code did not undergo extensive testing, static analysis and code review were employed to identify potential issues. Future testing will include more comprehensive methods to confirm secure and functional code post-refactoring.

Resources, Tools, and Practices for Future Use
Key Resources and Practices: Secure coding standards, OWASP Dependency-Check for managing third-party risks, and static analysis tools for continuous vulnerability detection are invaluable for maintaining security throughout development.

Value to Future Employers
This project demonstrates proficiency in vulnerability assessment and secure coding, showcasing skills in identifying and addressing security threats. Future employers can view this as evidence of my commitment to delivering secure software solutions that protect client data.
