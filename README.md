# Artemis Financial Secure Software Practices Report

## Summary of Client and Software Requirements
- **Client**: Artemis Financial, a financial services company focused on data protection.
- **Requirements**: Artemis sought a vulnerability assessment and secure coding practices to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive financial data. This included identifying and mitigating security risks, with an emphasis on encryption and secure data transmission.

## Identifying Software Security Vulnerabilities
- **What Was Done Well**: High-risk vulnerabilities were identified and prioritized based on their potential impact on Artemis's systems.
- **Importance of Secure Coding**: Secure coding prevents data breaches, builds client trust, and ensures compliance with industry regulations, enhancing company resilience and reputation.

## Challenges and Key Takeaways from the Vulnerability Assessment
- **Challenges**: Assessing Artemisâ€™s complex data flow was challenging, underscoring the importance of thorough analysis for robust security.
- **Helpful Aspects**: A structured approach allowed for systematic identification and resolution of vulnerabilities, highlighting the value of a secure SDLC (Black Duck, 2022).

## Increasing Layers of Security
- **Implemented Layers**: SSL/TLS protocols for encryption, AES for data confidentiality, and exception handling to guard against algorithm failures.
- **Future Tools and Techniques**: Automated vulnerability scanners and regular security audits would enhance proactive threat identification.

## Ensuring Functionality and Security Post-Refactor
- **Verification Process**: Static analysis and code review were used to identify potential issues. Future testing plans include more comprehensive methods to confirm secure and functional code post-refactoring.

## Resources, Tools, and Practices for Future Use
- **Key Resources and Practices**: Secure coding standards, OWASP Dependency-Check for managing third-party risks, and static analysis tools are crucial for maintaining security throughout development.

## Value to Future Employers
This project showcases proficiency in vulnerability assessment and secure coding, demonstrating skills in identifying and addressing security threats. This evidence of my commitment to delivering secure software solutions that protect client data is valuable for future employers.
